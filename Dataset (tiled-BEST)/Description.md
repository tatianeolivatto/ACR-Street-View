# Tiled Dataset Description
Tiled pre-processing technique was applied to the Original Dataset, resulting in 1095 labelled images from Google Street View covering Brazilian Cities (specifically São Paulo State). Altogheter, there are 1413 annotations of accessibility curb ramps divided in two folders: "obj" (80% of images in train folder) and "test" (20% of images in validation folder).

Annotations are in TXT extension, being compatible with YOLO annotations. If you need annotations in other extension, you can freely convert them using Roboflow (https://roboflow.com/).

Tiled was implemented using the YOLO-tiling tool developed by Rostyslav Neskorozhenyi, available at: https://github.com/slanj/yolo-tiling
