# Tiled Dataset Description
Tiled pre-processing technique was applied to the Original Dataset, resulting in 1095 labelled images from Google Street View covering Brazilian Cities (specifically SÃ£o Paulo State). Altogheter, there are 1413 annotations of accessibility curb ramps divided in two folders: "obj" (80% of images in train folder) and "test" (20% of images in validation folder).

Annotations are in TXT extension, being compatible with YOLO annotations. If you need annotations in other extension, you can freely convert them using Roboflow (https://roboflow.com/).

Tiled was implemented using the YOLO-tiling tool developed by Rostyslav Neskorozhenyi, available at: https://github.com/slanj/yolo-tiling
